## Summary

The purpose of this challenge was to take a JSON file with a varied data structure and create a data visualization analysis using JavaScript along with D3 and Plotly. When a user selects a sample ID, the corresponding bacteria and associated IDs should change on the site. The 3 types of charts used are bar, bubble, and gauge. The final deliverable included styling the page with different colors/backgrounds/fonts.
